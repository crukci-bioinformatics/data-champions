# Introducing your data champions

There is an increased emphasis on managing and sharing data produced in research; particularly in research that has been funded by public money. At the University-level, the [Research Data Management Team](http://www.data.cam.ac.uk/) provides support for researchers in various aspects of research data planning and management. Recently, they have also been recruiting so-called "*data champions*" to act as ambassadors to promote good data management within individual institutes. 

The following people have been selected as Data Champions for the C.I. Their role will be to provide advice and training on aspects of data management and sharing research data; as well as disseminating details of resources and events available to C.I. staff.

- Anne Pajon (Bioinformatics Core)
